# CSC4402-Spring23

This group project aims to create a web application load board for shippers and carriers in the trucking industry, utilizing a database to provide a simplified and user-friendly interface for accessing a wealth of information. This platform will contain important information such as pickup and delivery cities, weight of the load, trucker's name and company, DOT number, cost, distance, truck length, and type of load. By using this system, truck drivers will be able to view delivery information, including status, and sign up for their preferred choices. This will simplify the complex logistics process in the transportation industry.
