# CSC4402-Spring23

The purpose of this project is to utilize a database in order to create a trucking loadboard system, 
a platform in which contains crucial information such as: 
pickup and delivery cities, weight of the load, trucker's name and company, DOT number, cost, distance, truck length, and type of load.  By using this platform, truck drivers will be able to view the information regarding a delivery, including the status, and sign up for their desired choice.
